# FortigateConfig
This tool allows our team to generate a basic configuration for FortiGate firewalls

I wrote this tool for two reasons:
  - In 2022 we brought on a new client that will be deploying FortiGate firewalls to a few dozen sites over the next year. We needed a way to maximize productivity for       our team and decrease turnaround times for the client.
  - I had been administering FortiGates exclusively from the GUI to this point and wanted to break the seal on administering from CLI.

I'll be pushing improvements to this tool over the next few months.
